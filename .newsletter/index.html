<!--
Send me an email to list@nunosempere.com with subject "Subscribe to blog" and your name. 

There previously was a form here, but I think someone was inputting random emails, so that's it for now.

-->


<form method="post" action="https://list.nunosempere.com/subscription/form" class="listmonk-form">
    <div>
            <h3>Subscribe</h3>
            <input type="hidden" name="nonce" />
            <p><input type="email" name="email" required placeholder="E-mail" class="subscribe-input"/></p>
            <p><input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name (helps me filter out malicious entries)" class="subscribe-input"/></ap>
          
            <p>
	      <input id="c469b" type="checkbox" name="l" checked value="c469bee2-2754-4360-b97b-4f8d2bf62363" />
              <label for="c469b" style="font-size: 18px">nunosempere.com</label>
            </p>

        <p><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" class="subscribe-button"/></p>
    </div>
</form>

<p>
The reason why I am asking for subscribers' names is explained <a href="https://nunosempere.com/.newsletter/why-name">here</a>. Frequency is roughly once a week.
