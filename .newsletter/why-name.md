## Why I need subscribers' names

This took me a while to figure out:

- People wanting to overflow someone's inbox can subscribe them to a lot of newsletters.
- Because I'm using relatively standard software, I've been getting large numbers of spurious signups.
- Sending a confirmation email doesn't fix this, because then the victim is just overflowed with confirmation emails

So that's why I'll only accept subscriptions for which the person gives a real-sounding name. Apparently substack has also been experiencing problems with this.

Anyways, if you don't want to give a real name, you can just input "Testy McTestFace" or similar.
