Werc bounties
=============

[werc](https://werc.cat-v.org/) is the web technology that I am using to run this blog. It is relatively solid, but it has some annoyances that I don't always have the time to figure out. I intend to use this post as a reference for myself, and eventually send it to the werc people with monetary bounties attached once I have a few elements.
