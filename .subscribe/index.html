Send me an email to list@nunosempere.com with subject "Subscribe to blog" and your name. 

There previously was a form here, but I think someone was inputting random emails, so that's it for now.

<form method="post" action="https://list.nunosempere.com/subscription/form" class="listmonk-form">
    <div>
            <h3>Subscribe</h3>
            <input type="hidden" name="nonce" />
            <p><input type="email" name="email" required placeholder="E-mail" class="subscribe-input"/></p>
            <p><input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name (helps me filter out malicious entries)" class="subscribe-input"/></ap>
          
            <p>
              <input id="82ff8" type="checkbox" name="l" checked value="82ff889c-f9d9-4a45-bf9a-7e2696813021" />
              <label for="82ff8" style="font-size: 18px">nunosempere.com</label>

The point about malicious entries is curious, so I thought I'd explain it: People wanting to overflow someone's inbox can subscribe them to a lot of newsletters. Sending a confirmation email doesn't fix this, because then the victim is just overflowed with confirmation emails. Apparently substack has also been experiencing problems with this. Anyways, that's why I'll only accept subscriptions for which the person gives a real-sounding name.
