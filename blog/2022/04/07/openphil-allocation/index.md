Open Philanthopy's allocation by cause area
===========================================

Open Philanthropy's grants so far, roughly:

This only includes the top 8 areas. "Other areas" refers to grants tagged "Other areas" in [OpenPhil's database](https://openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants). So there are around $47M in known donations missing from that graph. There is also one (I presume fairly large) donation amount missing from OP's database, to [Impossible Foods](https://openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare/impossible-foods)
