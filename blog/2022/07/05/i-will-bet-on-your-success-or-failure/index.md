I will bet on your success on Manifold Markets
==============================================

If you create a market on [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/) on the outcome of an undertaking I will bet on its eventual success or failure. Because project creators or owners tend to be too optimistic about their success, this means that I will most often bet against your success.

This betting allows you to obtain a rough probability for the success of your project. Prediction markets aren't perfect, but a 5% is markedly different from a 50% or from a 90%.
