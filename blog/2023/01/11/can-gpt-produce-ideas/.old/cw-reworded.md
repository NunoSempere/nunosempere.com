One small insight I've gained from studying the humanities—I'm currently taking a philosophy degree on the side—is that conceptual wins or paradigm shifts have required laborious work and the passage of time.

Studying the humanities, I've noticed that conceptual wins or paradigm shifts require long, arduous work.

Some "conceptual wins" in the sense that I have in mind are:

- Explaining natural phenomena not in terms of Greek or Roman anthropomorphic gods, but with reference to naturalistic, physical explanations
- Understanding acceleration as distinct from motion
- Science as an experimental methodology
- The is/ought distinction
- Bayesian reasoning
- Ceasing to accept the divine right of kings as a justification for monarchical governance
- Randomized trials as a more robust way of generating generalizable knowledge
- The genealogical argument: understanding that systems (such as the details of the current prison system, our monetary system, the lack of color in men's clothes, or our attitudes towards gender and sex) are the result of historical accidents which could have gone differently. But often these systems are rationalized as being particularly adequate, or even morally necessary.

One of reasons to be afraid of artificial intelligence might be because, if you think in the abstract about how a system might behave as it becomes extremely intelligence, you might conclude that it might be able to completely outmaneuvre us because of its superior ontology, it's superior ability to grasp the true structure of the world. This possibility is scary in the same sense that a modern chemist is scary to a historical alchemist. Our current chemist can completely outmaneuvre previous alchemists by using their superior understanding of natural laws to producing better explosions, more subtle poisons, or more powerful drugs.

But it's not clear to me whether this fear—which I do buy in the limit for a being of God-like intelligence—also applies to current systems and its descendants. In particular for language models, at first glance it seems like they are powerful remixers and predictors, but perhaps limited to drawing from the conceptual toolkit which humans already have. On the other hand, because they have access to so much information, they might be able to be prompted so as to reveal new relationships, connections and insights.

So I'd be interested about the extent to which *current* AI systems are able to come up with better understandings of the world, and thus potentially in the future acquire an advantage over humans. One simple experiment one could do is to ask a language model to replicate a few patterns of generating insight that humanity hasn't really exploited much yet, such as:

- Variations on "if you never miss a plane, you've been spending too much time at the airport".
- Variations on the genealogical argument above against the moral necessity of systems stemming from historical accidents.
- Variations on the Robin Hanson argument of "for common human behaviour X, its usual purported justification is Y, but it usually results in more Z than Y. If we cared about Y, we might do A instead".
