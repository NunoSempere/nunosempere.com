<h1 id="can-gpt-3-produce-new-ideas-automating-robin-hanson-and-others">Can GPT-3 produce new ideas? Automating Robin Hanson and others</h1>
<p>One small insight I've gained from studying the humanities—I'm currently taking a philosophy degree on the side—is that conceptual wins or paradigm shifts have required laborious work and the passage of time.</p>
<p>Some "conceptual wins" in the sense that I have in mind are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining natural phenomena not in terms of Greek or Roman anthropomorphic gods, but with reference to naturalistic, physical explanations</li>
<li>Understanding acceleration as distinct from motion</li>
<li>Science as an experimental methodology</li>
<li>The is/ought distinction</li>
<li>Bayesian reasoning</li>
<li>Ceasing to accept the divine right of kings as a justification for monarchical governance</li>
<li>Randomized trials as a more robust way of generating generalizable knowledge</li>
<li>The genealogical argument: understanding that systems (such as the details of the current prison system, our monetary system, the lack of color in men's clothes, or our attitudes towards gender and sex) are the result of historical accidents which could have gone differently. But often these systems are rationalized as being particularly adequate, or even morally necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of reasons to be afraid of artificial intelligence might be because, if you think in the abstract about how a system might behave as it becomes extremely intelligence, you might conclude that it might be able to completely outmaneuvre us because of its superior ontology, it's superior ability to grasp the true structure of the world. This possibility is scary in the same sense that a modern chemist is scary to a historical alchemist. Our current chemist can completely outmaneuvre previous alchemists by using their superior understanding of natural laws to producing better explosions, more subtle poisons, or more addictive and mind-blowing drugs.</p>
<p>But it's not clear to me whether this fear—which I do buy in the limit for a being of God-like intelligence—also applies to current systems and its descendants. In particular for language models, at first glance it seems like they are powerful remixers and predictors, but perhaps limited to drawing from the conceptual toolkit which humans already have. On the other hand, because they have access to so much information, they might be able to be prompted so as to reveal new relationships, connections and insights.</p>
<p>So I'd be interested about the extent to which <em>current</em> AI systems are able to come up with better understandings of the world, and thus potentially in the future acquire an advantage over humans.</p>
<p>The simplest experiment in this direction one could do is to ask a language model to replicate a few patterns of generating insight that humanity hasn't really exploited much yet, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variations on "if you never miss a plane, you've been spending too much time at the airport".</li>
<li>Variations on the Robin Hanson argument of "for common human behaviour X, its usual purported justification is Y, but it usually results in more Z than Y. If we cared about Y, we might do A instead".</li>
<li>Variations on the genealogical argument above against the moral necessity of systems stemming from historical accidents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the argument "We pretend that healthcare is giving people better and longer lives.

<h2 id="if-x-was-a-historical-accident-then-this-is-a-hint-that-this-isnt-the-best-or-moral-choice">If X was a historical accident, then this is a hint that this isn't the best or moral choice.</h2>
<p>Input to text-davinci-003</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the argument "The fact that men don't wear clothing with adornments is a historical accident. We could easily imagine a world in which this wasn't the case, look to other societies elsewhere or in the past, or read the wikipedia page about the great male renunciation. Therefore the fact that men don't wear elaborate clothing isn't a moral necessity, but rather a historical accident."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another argument of this form might be "Prisons as currently structured were influenced by Bentham's panopticon and other historical accidents. Other societies have different forms of prevention, punishment and remediation. So we don't have to have the current prison system, but instead could choose to have other alternatives".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A third example might be "Our current conception of morality is heavily influenced by Christianity. In particular, we can look about how we spend great efforts helping the weak, and how we view the powerful with suspicion and resentment. But the Greeks, for example, had a different morality, where they cherished strength. Makes you think."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The general pattern is "X is the result of a historical accident, as we can see because of Y. Z is a society which doesn't have this. From this, we can start to suspect that X is not the best or most moral choice. We could have other choices, such as A."</p>

<li>Our current educational system is heavily influenced by the industrial revolution, but in other societies, such as the Amish, education is focused on vocational skills. This suggests that our current system is not the only way to teach children.</li>

<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>The way in which we view mental health is heavily influenced by the medical model, which has been the dominant paradigm for the past century. Other societies have different ways of thinking about mental health and wellness, suggesting that the medical model is not the only way to think about mental health.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>The way in which we view gender roles is heavily influenced by the Judeo-Christian tradition. In some societies, gender roles are much more fluid or non-existent. This suggests that our current gender roles are not the only way to structure society.</li>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>The way in which we make decisions is heavily influenced by our reliance on data and algorithms. In some societies, decisions are made more intuitively or by consensus. This suggests that data-driven decision making is not the only way to make decisions.</li>
