no matter where you stand
=========================
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">When in a dark night the chamber of guf whispers<br>that I have failed, that I am failing, that I'll fail<br>I become mute, lethargic, frightful and afraid<br>of the pain I'll cause and the pain I'll endure.<br><br>Many were the times that I started but stopped<br>Many were the balls that I juggled and dropped<br>Many the people I discouraged and spooked<br>And the times I did good, I did less than I'd hoped<br><br>And then I remember that measure is unceasing,<br>that if you are a good man, why not a better man?<br>that if a better man, why not a great man?<br><br>and if you are a great man, why not yet a god?<br>And if a god, why not yet a better god?<br>measure is unceasing, no matter where you stand<br></div>
