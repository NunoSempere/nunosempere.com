<h1>Inflation-proof assets</h1>

<p>Can you have an asset whose value isn&rsquo;t subject to inflation? I review a few examples, and ultimatly conclude that probably not. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this in the context of prediction markets—where a stable asset would be useful—and in the context of my own financial strategy, which I want to be robust. But these thoughts are fairly unsophisticated.</p>

<p>Some other asset classes I looked into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Government bonds</li>
<li>Real state assets</li>
<li>Various financial instruments</li>
<li>Venture capitalist investments</li>
<li>A clan or family</li>
<li>Some other engine of value</li>
<li>Prestige</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<h2>General argument</h2>

<p>Large levels of wealth correspond to claims on the labor of other people, and in the longer term, over the labor of people who don&rsquo;t yet exist. But future generations can always renegue on the promises made by their predecessors, for instance by inflating their currency. Therefore, a general inflation-proof asset doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d be more optimistic about inflation avoidance strategies if they directly addressed that argument.</p>

<h2>Caveats to the general argument</h2>

<p>Even if you can&rsquo;t get a generic inflation-proof asset, you can probably get partial protection through stocks &amp; other instruments. Probably an optimal strategy would be to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use stocks/bonds/mainstream financial instruments to counteract run-of-the-mill inflation</li>
<li>Have some amount of gold/silver/cryptocurrencies which could be useful in the case of various catastrophes.</li>
</ol>


<p>Overall, though, I view the second step as pretty much optional and a bit paranoid. It&rsquo;s not clear what the level is at which I&rsquo;d actually implement it, but it&rsquo;s definitely higher than my current net worth.</p>
