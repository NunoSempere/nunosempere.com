Twitter Improvement Proposal: Incorporate Prediction Markets, Give a Death Blow to Punditry
===========================================================================================

**tl;dr**: Incorporate prediction markets into Twitter, give a death blow to punditry. 

## The core idea

A prediction market is...

## Why do this?

Because it will usher humanity in an era of epistemic greatness. 

## Caveats and downsides

Play money, though maybe with goods and services

Give 1000 doublons to all semi-active accounts on the 22/02/2022

## How to go about this?

One possiblity might be to acquihire [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/) for something like $20-$50M. They are a team of competent engineers with a fair share of ex-Googlers, who have been doing a good job at building a prediction platform from scratch, and iterating on it. So one possible step might be to have the Manifold guys come up with demo functionality, and then pair them with a team who understands how one would go about doing this at Twitter-like scale. 



However, I am not really cognizant of the technical challenges here, and it's possible that might not be the best approach ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## In conclusion
