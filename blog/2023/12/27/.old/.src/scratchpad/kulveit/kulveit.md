## Hierarchial Networked Structure

In [What to do with people?](), Jan Kulveit[^kulveit] proposed having "hierarchical networked structures" as a broad-level answer to the problem of how to organize EA labor. The idea is to subdivide EA into a tree-like structure, such that each layer manages the next. I think that's possibly one of the most valuable & underrated EA Forum posts of the last few years.

[^kulveit]: Whom I otherwise intensely dislike for various personal reasons.

Some excerpts:

> An example of a hierarchy in physical space could be the structure of local effective altruism groups: it is hard to coordinate an unstructured group of 10 thousands people. It is less hard, but still difficult to coordinate a structure of 200 “local groups” with widely different sizes, cultures and memberships. The optimal solution likely is to coordinate something like 5-25 “regional” coordinators/ hub leaders, who then coordinate with the local groups. The underlying theoretical reasons for such a structure are simple considerations like “network distance” or “bandwidth constraints”.

> A hierarchy in functional space could be for example a hierarchy of organizations and projects providing people career advice. It is difficult to give personalized career advice to tens of thousands of people as a small and lean organization. Scalable hierarchical version of career advice may look like this: based on general request, a student considering future study plans is redirected to e.g. Effective Thesis, specialized on the problem. Further, the student is connected with a specialist coach with object-level knowledge. The hierarchical structure could in my guess scale approximately 100x more than a single organization focusing just on picking the few most impactful people.

In a parallel world, the Effective Altruism movement 

In a parallel world, the Center for Effective Altruism and Open Philanthropy are never one single organization 

In a parallel world, the Institute for Effective Coordination is founded by a charismatic figure that thinks about these dynamics earlier. The Center for Effective Altruism and Open Philanthropy are never two separate organizations, but rather one organization that is actually competent
