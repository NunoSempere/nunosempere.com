Maybe these visions of EA show that EA is much less constrained than it appears

Effective Altruism seems to me to be in the same position as *Occupy Wall Street* after the 2008 crisis: laudable aims, but deeply disappointing practices. In the current system, different appendages of Effective Altruism mostly ultimately all drink from the central tit of Open Philanthropy, and a centralizing Center for Effective Altruism makes it hard to conceive of alternative means of organization. Maybe these alternative visions of how Effective Altruism could look like show that EA is much less constrained than it appears.
