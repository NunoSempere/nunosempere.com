# Variants of what effective altruism could have been, and still might be.

1. A competent army that is able to figure out where each person can do the most good and deploy them in that position—imagine the Illuminati, some idealized version of the US military, or an up-and-coming startup.
2. A decentralized cell model, where different subgroups organize and carry out their own designs, perhaps funded by their own members and guided by their own determinations—think an anarchist cell model trying to act robustly in enemy territory, development of the Linux kernel[^linux], [Direct Action Everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Action_Everywhere).
3. A bureaucracy that has some notional goals but is staffed by fallible humans and pursuing its goals slowly and imperfectly—imagine your average government agency, a large & sclerotic company, the Catholic Church, etc.

[^linux]: Linux has both centralized and decentralized features. In terms of centralization, you have the fact that Linus Torvalds ultimately decides what goes in. In terms of decentralization, you have the fact that anyone can contribute, package it, fork it, improve it. I think that the centralization aspects would hurt and be more salient if Linus was incompetent and/or stringent, but as is, he seems competent and laid back enough that he can enable and channel a wide community around Linux, rather than holding it back. Note, though, that this is my impression from a distance, and the reader is welcome to take this as a pointer to how a social movement could work. Though e.g., tools like git *do* enable decentralized cooperation.

Here are some more right-wing coded flavours of effective altruism: 

- Effective capitalism: Capitalism has been a powerful engine for progress, and companies like Musk's SpaceX are at the forefront of pushing humanity further. Build scalable companies that produce vast amounts of goods, capture some of that profit, and scale up. 
  - Keep in mind Goodhart's law, though, and don't become evil; to make that easier, consider bootstrapping instead of taking VC funding, and not taking your company public.
  - Structuring things as a business instead of as a charity allows you to cease to depend on 
- Renewal in American politics: Biden => decay, promising upstarts like Ron de Santis, Vivek Ramaswamy, or Nikky Hailey. Working for their campaign tropecientos QALYs. If they are elected, but also if they end up belonging in a second Trump administration. Particulary if Ramaswamy 


### 6. The whole thing is a very specific, US-American, Elizabeth Warren type of lefty


You start out wanting to do the most good, and you end up with this specific

- Effective Altruism women's wine night
- petite burgeoisie
- harvoring bored middle class people who want to feel like they are contributing to a cause

Flavour of mistakes that they make: criminal justice reform.
