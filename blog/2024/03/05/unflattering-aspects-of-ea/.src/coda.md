### 8. So, how sure am I about any of this?

I am pretty sure that the points above describe real dynamics. 

I am not sure to what extent they are overestated; that is, these dynamics might be going on, but to a lesser extent than I make it seem, or less often. I got some advice from a writers group I'm participating in that adding constant caveats and expressions of uncertainty made the central thesis less clear, and I thought that was a good point, so I reduced caveats from an earlier draft, though still left some. Yet, all the caveats about uncertain criticism in [here](https://forum.nunosempere.com/user/negativenuno) apply. 

I also, dispositionally, find it easy to see the flaws in things.

I am uncertain about the comparison between EA and other alternatives. I think that some proto-EAs would be better off exploring other alternatives, particularly those that buy them financial independence and unaccountability, but I'm uncertain about what fraction that is. I think that for current EAs, applying to some [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-roles-on-our-gcr-team) roles probably had a high value of information, even if I'm skeptical of the organization.

I think that other critics, like e.g., 

- A version of these is definitely true
- Maybe overstated. I tried to caveat 
- Criticism caveats
- Depression, easy to see the negative
- Value of information Open Phil
- Most uncertain about the comparative aspect

=> added short epistemic status instead.
