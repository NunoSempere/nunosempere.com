Leadership without consent
==========================

The central EA machinery, at organizations like CEA or Open Philanthropy, have some characteristic that make it very unappealing for me to consider them as a source of leadership, i.e. as a source of guidance, evaluation, moral direction:

- The way they make decisions is opaque to me
- They have different priorities than me, and in particular they are committed to worldview diversification, which I consider suboptimal
- They have an unfocused glaze. Because they are so large, they have "seeing like a state" problems, e.g., they were previously only able to make large forecasting grants, shaping the forecasting ecosystem towards large organizations in ways which I think were suboptimal

As a result, if they hold some kind of leadership over the EA community, my impression is that this is to some extent a leadership without consent, a leadership without listening and telegraphing on'es priorities so that they can coordinate better with those they lead.

And in a sense, that makes sense. Open Philanthropy is a bureaucracy spun up to spend a billionnaire's wealth according to his broad directions. It would then be surprising if they were able to listen to and address the worries and concerns of a roughly 10k strong community. 

But also as a result, I don't feel particularly inclined to take my cues from that machinery. If, for example, the Effective Altruism Forum starts using a heavier moderating hand, promoting content that doesn't appeal to me and complexifying the UX in a way which annoys me, I don't have a vote.

I can "write up my perspective" for free, meaning that I am reduced to nagging, because I have no real control. Alternatively, I can create my own frontend, which I can customize as I will. Or I can go out on my own, and help build different and smaller communities, where my greater involvement means that I will have more of a voice.
