No other billionnaire has wanted to use Open Philanthropy

Agglomerating more stuff inside OpenPhil

That if you could do well inside of EA, you could do better outside of it

This means you can't implement [Auftragstaktiken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission-type_tactics)[^auftragstaktiken]—a well-regarded method of command which gives subordinates wide latitude and the ressources they need to achieve well-defined objectives—if can't specify well-defined objectives, and don't trust your subordinates to boot.

[^auftragstaktiken]: I've improved the introduction of the English version of the Wikipedia page on *Auftragstaktik*, but the German version remains [more informative](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BChren_mit_Auftrag).

Bounties and shit.

### 6.1. You can move faster than that

### 6.2. Playing for access is the wrong game to be playing

- Access privileged to romantic relationships
  - Buys you priviledging the hypothesis

- Access is the wrong game to be playing
  - Nerds / Autochtonous
  - Not solved by increasing throughput

- Dependency on the flow, running on borrowed power

### 6.3. Leaders don't seek the consent of the governed

- Leadership without consent
- Different priorities
- Shitty feedback loops. You don't get a vote. 
  - Would you rather contribute your soul to something where you do get a vote?
  - You aren't heard.
  - You aren't heard, and you don't get a vote.
- Leadership not unaccountable

### 6.4. They have very particular priorities 

### 6.5. Hypocritically constrain the rank and file by pointing to the dangers of maximization

### And a grab-bag of other things

Unfocused glaze

Nick Beckstead did a completely different organization at FTX Future Fund.

## 7. Therefore, it makes sense to go your own way

Pursue some of the alternative visions of EA. EA much less constrained.

You, the EA best, don't go into the arms of Open Philanthropy, but instead forth into the world.

Band of brothers disciplined by the market.

Sixth, jockeing for access is the name of the game, but it's the wrong game to be playing. 

From the top down, jockeing for access has been the game of the game because Open Philanthropy has been slow to trust people to work for them. This leads their current employees to be overworked, busy and unapproachable[^promotion]. In practice, people go to great lengths to try to approach and socialize with Open Philanthropy employees, like visiting or moving to the San Francisco Bay area.

[^promotion]: Readers are also welcome to hypothesize what else happens if trust is scarce. Perhaps [promotion to incompetence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) across the people that are trusted? Or exacerbation of inner circle dynamics?

That grantmakers are busy and unavailable makes getting access to them hard, because the group has limited available throughput. But if had a larger throughput, if lines of communication to Open Philanthropy were more open, if the game is still to rub elbows and to compete for access, then that game would still be broken. You don't want to have a pool of talent optimizing hard competing for attention, you want to have a pool of talent working hard at making the world a better place[^anonymous]. 

[^anonymous]: You can solve this problem by being anonymous. Here is a Robin Hanson-like design: have a cohort of anonymous regrantors and allow members of the public to make $20k bets at 1:2 odds on whether any one particular person is a grantmaker. This ensures that your regrantors will remain anonymous. Anonymous philanthropy has precendents, see e.g., [here](https://forum.nunosempere.com/posts/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/chuck-feeney-1931-2023).

From the bottom up, jockeing for access is the name of the game because an aspiring EA will start with the intention of doing large amounts of good, and will try to do something semi-ambitious. Then he'll find out that funding constraints are a big part of making shit happen. And when solving that funding bottleneck, he will be in a social context where the natural good move is to try to get access to a busy, overworked, and therefore unavailable group of Open Philanthropy grantmakers[^4]<sup>,</sup>[^access]. 

[^4]: Doesn't seem like a great [attachment theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory) setup.

[^access]: Incidentally, having romantic relationships with Open Philanthropy employees increases [access](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/trqswoctpQ92tcY2y/criticism-thread-what-things-should-openphil-improve-on) to that coterie. That is, I suspect that having a close relationship with Open Phil people [privileges the hypothesis](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/privileging-the-hypothesis) that your grant is worth evaluation. 

And it's the wrong game to be playing because if you look at autochtonous EAs, at the rank and file, many are nerds, nerds who are able to do good work but who will find it hard to. Their winning move would be not to play, and to gain real power by building something independently.
