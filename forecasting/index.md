## Forecasting

My forecasting group is known as Samotsvety. You can read more about it [here](https://samotsvety.org/).

### Newsletter

I am perhaps most well-known for my monthly forecasting _newsletter_. It can be found both [on Substack](https://forecasting.substack.com/) and [on the EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/HXtZvHqsKwtAYP6Y7). Besides its mothly issues, I've also written:

- [Tracking the money flows in forecasting](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/11/06/forecasting-money-flows/)
- [Looking back at 2021](https://forecasting.substack.com/p/looking-back-at-2021)
- [Forecasting Postmortem: The Fall of Kabul](https://forecasting.substack.com/p/postmortem-the-fall-of-kabul) (paywalled)
- [2020: Forecasting in Review](https://forecasting.substack.com/p/2020-forecasting-in-review)

### Research

As part of my research at the [Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute](https://quantifieduncertainty.org/), and previously as an independent researcher, I have a few _in depth pieces_ on forecasting:

- [Alignment Problems With Current Forecasting Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11248)  
- [Amplifying generalist research via forecasting – models of impact and challenges](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZCZZvhYbsKCRRDTct/part-1-amplifying-generalist-research-via-forecasting-models) and [part 2](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZTXKHayPexA6uSZqE/part-2-amplifying-generalist-research-via-forecasting).

### Funding

I have occasionally advised philanthropic funders—mostly from the effective altruism community—on forecasting related topics and projects. 

I have run a few contests:

- [$5k challenge to quantify the impact of 80,000 hours' top career paths](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/09/23/usd5k-challenge-to-quantify-the-impact-of-80-000-hours-top/)

### Squiggle

I've done bunch of work around Squiggle, a language for creating quick probability estimates. You can read about this [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/squiggle).
