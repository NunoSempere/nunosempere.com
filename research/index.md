## Current projects

I'm currently doing [private consulting](https://nunosempere.com/consulting/), and writting up my desillusionment with EA:

## Past projects

_Estimation of values_

I spent a few years of my life grappling with EA (effective altruism) being nominally about doing the most good, but it not having good tools to identify and prioritize across possible interventions. Eventually I gave up when I got it through my thick head that despite my earlier hopes, there wasn't much demand for the real version of this—as opposed to the fake version of pretending to evaluate stuff, and pretending to be "impact oriented". Still, I think it's an interesting body of research.

_Red teaming_

If you are trying to be as effective as you can, wouldn't you like someone to point out where you might be going wrong? Not so!

- The [NegativeNuno](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/negativenuno) EA Forum account covers negative criticism that I'm uncertain about.

_Shapley values_:

If you care about doing good together, you should care about how to coordinate on who does which projects. Shapley values solve this, as does adjusting the counterfactual value to be more like Shapley values. I named my consultancy after this concept.

- [Shapley Values: Better Than Counterfactuals](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHZJ9i7QBtAJZ6byW/shapley-values-better-than-counterfactuals) 
- [Shapley Values and Philanthropic Coordination Theory](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3NYDwGvDbhwenpDHb/shapley-values-reloaded-philantropic-coordination-theory-and)

_Economic models of social movement growth_:

You can make progress on gnarly economics questions by [throwing](https://github.com/NunoSempere/ReverseShooting/tree/master) compute at [it](https://github.com/NunoSempere/LaborCapitalAndTheOptimalGrowthOfSocialMovements/tree/master). Unfortunately, reality is complicated enough that these models won't capture all the assumptions you care about, and so might not be all that informative in real life.

- [A Model of Patient Spending and Movement Building](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FXPaccMDPaEZNyyre/a-model-of-patient-spending-and-movement-building)
- [Labor, Capital, and the Optimal Growth of Social Movements](https://nunosempere.github.io/ea/MovementBuildingForUtilityMaximizers.pdf)

_Categorization of new causes_:

Let's just create some obvious infrastructure to track suggestions that people make!

- [Big List of Cause Candidates](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SCqRu6shoa8ySvRAa/big-list-of-cause-candidates)
- [A Funnel for Cause Candidates](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iRA4Dd2bfX9nukSo3/a-funnel-for-cause-candidates)
- [International Supply Chain Accountability](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ME4zE34KBSYnt6hGp/new-top-ea-cause-international-supply-chain-accountability)  
- I am paying someone to update this list with causes proposed in 2021.

_Technological discontinuities_:

People are talking about "technological discontinuities". How often do they happen?

- [A prior for technological discontinuities](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FaCqw2x59ZFhMXJr9/a-prior-for-technological-discontinuities)
