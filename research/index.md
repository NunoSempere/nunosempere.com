Most of my research can be found [on the EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nunosempere). For forecasting related research, see [forecasting](/forecasting)

## Current research

Besides forecasting (of probabilities), a major thread in my research is estimation (of values). Pieces related to this topic are:

Relatedly, I have an interest in _red teaming_,

- The [NegativeNuno](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/negativenuno) EA Forum account covers negative criticism that I'm uncertain about.
- A past piece on this topic is [Frank Feedback Given To Very Junior Researchers](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7utb4Fc9aPvM6SAEo/frank-feedback-given-to-very-junior-researchers)

## Past projects

In the past, I've been much more eclectic, and explored a variety of topics, such as:

_Shapley values_:
