Most of my software projects can be seen in [my github](https://github.com/NunoSempere/), or on the github of the [Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute](https://github.com/QURIresearch). In recent times, I've been working on [Metaforecast](https://metaforecast.org/), a forecast aggregator.

I'm generally excited about linux development, privacy preserving tools, open source projects, and more generally, software which gives power to the user.

Cool misc programming:
- [LongNowForMd](https://github.com/NunoSempere/longNowForMd): A tool for adding (a) for archive.org links to markdown files 
- [Labeling](https://github.com/NunoSempere/labeling), an R package which I mantain. It's used in ggplot2, through the scales package, and thus has 500k+ downloads a month.  
- [Predict, resolve and tally](https://github.com/NunoSempere/PredictResolveTally)  
- [Q: A program for analyzing Spanish poetry](https://blogdelecturadenuno.blogspot.com/2020/12/q-un-programa-para-escribir-y-analizar-poemas-y-poesia.html)
