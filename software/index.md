Many of my software projects can be seen in [my github](https://github.com/NunoSempere/), or on the github of the [Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute](https://github.com/QURIresearch), where I working on [Metaforecast](https://metaforecast.org/), a forecast aggregator, and on [Squiggle](https://www.squiggle-language.com/), a small programming language for estimation. Currently, I'm also hosting my stuff at [git.nunosempere.com](https://git.nunosempere.com/)

I'm generally excited about Linux development, privacy preserving tools, open source projects, and more generally, software which gives power to the user.

Some programming projects:

*Estimation-related*:

- [fermi](https://git.nunosempere.com/NunoSempere/fermi): a calculator-style domain-specific language for fermi estimation.
- [Time to botec](https://git.nunosempere.com/personal/time-to-botec): Simple Fermi estimation scripts which do the same in different programming languages. 
- [squiggle.c](https://git.nunosempere.com/personal/squiggle.c): A grug-brained, self-contained C99 library that provides a subset of Squiggle's functionality in C.
- [Find a beta distribution that fits your desired confidence interval](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2023/03/15/fit-beta/)
- [Predict, resolve and tally](https://github.com/NunoSempere/PredictResolveTally): A small bash utility for making predictions. 
- [Simple Squiggle](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/simple-squiggle), a restricted subset of Squiggle syntax useful for multiplying and dividing lognormal distributions analytically.

A thread throughout my work in recent years has been trading off accessibility and public reach for simplicity, speed and [soothingness](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2023/03/27/soothing-software/). In particular, I've moved away from javascript and into C and go. I particularly like [fermi](https://git.nunosempere.com/NunoSempere/fermi) and [squiggle.c](https://git.nunosempere.com/personal/squiggle.c) as examples of the thing I'm aiming for: simple software all of whose parts I can understand, whose randomization primitives I've researched, and whose correctness I can be very sure of. In this, I've been inspired by [cat-v](https://cat-v.org/) and [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/)

*Simplicity and minimalism*:

- [Webpages I am making available to my corner of the internet](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2023/08/14/software-i-am-hosting/)
- [A Soothing Frontend for the Effective Altruism Forum](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2023/04/18/forum-frontend/)
- [wc: count words in <50 lines of C](https://git.nunosempere.com/personal/wc)
- [Longnow](https://github.com/NunoSempere/longNowForMd): A tool for adding (a) for archive.org links to markdown files 
- [NuÃ±o's stupid node version manager](https://github.com/NunoSempere/nsnvm): Because nvm noticeably slowed down bash startup time, and 20 line of bash can do the job.
- [Werc tweaks](https://github.com/NunoSempere/werc-1.5.0-tweaks). I like the idea behind [werc](https://werc.cat-v.org/), and I've tweaked it a bit when hosting this website
- [German pronoun](https://github.com/NunoSempere/german_pronoun), a small bash script to get the correct gender for german nouns

*Other*:

- [rosenrot](https://github.com/NunoSempere/rosenrot-browser/): A clean browser based on webkit2 and GTK4.
- [shapleyvalue.com](https://github.com/NunoSempere/shapleyvalue.com)
- [Labeling](https://github.com/NunoSempere/labeling): An R package which I mantain. It's used in ggplot2, through the scales package, and thus has 500k+ downloads a month.  
- [Q](https://blogdelecturadenuno.blogspot.com/2020/12/q-un-programa-para-escribir-y-analizar-poemas-y-poesia.html): A program for analyzing Spanish poetry.
- [Rosebud](https://github.com/NunoSempere/rose-browser), my [personal fork](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/12/20/hacking-on-rose/) of  [rose](https://github.com/mini-rose/rose), which is a simple browser written in C. I've been using this as my mainline browser for a bit now, and enjoy the simplicity.
- Several [turing machines](https://git.nunosempere.com/personal/Turing_Machine), the last of which finds the nth prime.
