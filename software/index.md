Most of my software projects can be seen in [my github](https://github.com/NunoSempere/), or on the github of the [Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute](https://github.com/QURIresearch). In recent times, I've been working on [Metaforecast](https://metaforecast.org/), a forecast aggregator, and on [Squiggle](https://www.squiggle-language.com/), a small programming language for estimation.

I'm generally excited about linux development, privacy preserving tools, open source projects, and more generally, software which gives power to the user.

Some miscellaneous programming projects:

- [Longnow](https://github.com/NunoSempere/longNowForMd): A tool for adding (a) for archive.org links to markdown files 
- [Labeling](https://github.com/NunoSempere/labeling): An R package which I mantain. It's used in ggplot2, through the scales package, and thus has 500k+ downloads a month.  
- [Predict, resolve and tally](https://github.com/NunoSempere/PredictResolveTally): A small bash utility for making predictions. 
- [Q](https://blogdelecturadenuno.blogspot.com/2020/12/q-un-programa-para-escribir-y-analizar-poemas-y-poesia.html): A program for analyzing Spanish poetry.
