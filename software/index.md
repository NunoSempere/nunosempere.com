Most of my software projects can be seen in [my github](https://github.com/NunoSempere/), or on the github of the [Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute](https://github.com/QURIresearch). In recent times, I've been working on [Metaforecast](https://metaforecast.org/), a forecast aggregator, and on [Squiggle](https://www.squiggle-language.com/), a small programming language for estimation.

I'm generally excited about Linux development, privacy preserving tools, open source projects, and more generally, software which gives power to the user.

Some miscellaneous programming projects:

- [Longnow](https://github.com/NunoSempere/longNowForMd): A tool for adding (a) for archive.org links to markdown files 
- [Labeling](https://github.com/NunoSempere/labeling): An R package which I mantain. It's used in ggplot2, through the scales package, and thus has 500k+ downloads a month.  
- [Predict, resolve and tally](https://github.com/NunoSempere/PredictResolveTally): A small bash utility for making predictions. 
- [Q](https://blogdelecturadenuno.blogspot.com/2020/12/q-un-programa-para-escribir-y-analizar-poemas-y-poesia.html): A program for analyzing Spanish poetry.
- [Rosebud](https://github.com/NunoSempere/rose-browser), my [personal fork](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/12/20/hacking-on-rose/) of  [rose](https://github.com/mini-rose/rose), which is a simple browser written in C. I've been using this as my mainline browser for a bit now, and enjoy the simplicity.
- [Simple Squiggle](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/simple-squiggle), a restricted subset of Squiggle syntax useful for multiplying and dividing lognormal distributions analytically.
- [Time to BOTEC](https://github.com/NunoSempere/time-to-botec): doing simple Fermi estimation in various different programming languages, so far C, R, python, javascript and squiggle.
- [Nu√±o's stupid node version manager](https://github.com/NunoSempere/nsnvm): Because nvm noticeably slowed down bash startup time, and 20 line of bash can do the job.
- [Werc tweaks](https://github.com/NunoSempere/werc-1.5.0-tweaks). I like the idea behind [werc](https://werc.cat-v.org/), and I've tweaked it a bit when hosting this website
- [German pronoun](https://github.com/NunoSempere/german_pronoun), a small bash script to get the correct gender for german nouns
- [shapleyvalue.com](https://github.com/NunoSempere/shapleyvalue.com)
- Several [turing machines](https://git.nunosempere.com/personal/Turing_Machine), the last of which finds the nth prime.
